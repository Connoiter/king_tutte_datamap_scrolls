# Datamapping talks

This directory (or HTTP Collection if this Markdown file is
transcribed to HTML and served over the web) is an index listing of
tech talks related to datamapping. Each tech talk can be found in a
separate file, linked to from this index.

The content topic is a mix of high dimensional maths (topological data
analysis, a.k.a TDA) and datamapping codes (read: softwares).

Since the good folks at the Tutte Institute invented a lot of the
datamapping technology, they also gave a lot of the talks. Some
of those folks are:
- Leland McInnes
- John Healy
- Benoit Hamelin
But folks besides Tutte Institute individuals are also included, as
long as the topic is datamapping.

The goal is to provide backgrounders and how-to for self-study and
for use by agents using this repo built as an Agent Skill. As such,
the full transcripts are included.
