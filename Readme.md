# King Tutte Scrolls

An agglomeration of permissively licensed code and docs for building
datamaps, the bulk of which actually comes out of the Tutte Institute
in Canada. The goal is to make it easy for coder (both humans and daemons)
to bang out datamaps.

## Background

### History

[The Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing
(TIMC)](https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en/mission/research-cse/tutte-institute-mathematics-computing)
is a Canadian government funded academic institute, named after
[W. T. Tutte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Tutte). Bill Tutte
was an English and Canadian code breaker and mathematician. During
WW2, he was working alongside the likes of Alan Turing cracking the
Nazi's encrypted comms at Bletchley Park. Tutte worked to crack the
German High Command comms code known as "Fish," a nut harder to crack
than the more famous Enigma machine cracking.

Separately, King Tutankhamun, also known as **King Tut** (not Tutte),
was an Egyptian pharaoh who ruled c. 1332 – 1323 BC during the late
Eighteenth Dynasty of ancient Egypt.

## What's with the name, King Tutte?

Back to modern times: some of the folks at TIMC are high dimensional
mathemeticians, a type of scientist not a type of engineer. They have
come down out of their ivory tower and have engaged in the grubby
practice of software *engieneering* for the purpose of diffusing their
*scientific* innovations. This involves solid, pricipled maths-based
tools such as UMAP and HDBSCAN which implement provably correct
algorithms (unlike, say, LLMs), as well as UI-centric software such as
DataMapPlot required so that folks can see the output of said
mathematical processes.

These repos can be configured together to implement –– amongst other
things –– what is herein called a King Tutte pipeline. In this repo,
these King Tutte pipeline-variants (code and Jypyter notebooks) use
multiple repositories of code out of the Tutte Institute, such as UMAP,
HDBSCAN, EVoC, DataMapPlot, Toponymy, Glasbly, and Vectorizers. Ergo
the name King Tutte.
